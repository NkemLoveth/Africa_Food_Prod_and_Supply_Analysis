# Africa_Food_Prod_and_Supply_Analysis

Hamoye[HDSC Summer 22] Internship
A project on Data StoryTelling in Pattern Recognition

The aim of this project is to tell a story of how the food shortage problem in Africa can be solved using visualizations and making each variable in the dataset purposeful. This Analysis will contain visualizations and narratives that will show:
Trends in food production and consumption over the years.
Average and median food production, the outliers, Quartile and interquartile ranges.
A comparison between average food consumption and production for each year.

Data Source
The data used for this project is the Food Production and Consumption in Africa  obtained from the  FAOâ€™s resources. A dataset containing world countries and their country codes was also imported from kaggle.

Insights
Although Nigeria, Egypt and South Africa are the highest food producing countries, of these 3 countries only Egypt is recorded to have one of the highest food supply from 2004-2013.
The countries with highest food production dont have high food supply, which means that the amount of food supplied over the years is relatively smaller compared to the amount of food produced.
Although correlation does not imply causation, it would be expected that the more food a country produces, the more food will be supplied or consumed. For Nigeria and South Africa, this isn't the case as there is a smaller amount of food supplied compared to the amount of food produced which can mean that there is a possible food shortage in African countries between 2004 and 2013
Other factors may contribute to the food shortage problem like price inflation, exportation, poor storage facilities etc . These claims cannot be confirmed until extra data is available to analyze these possibilities.
